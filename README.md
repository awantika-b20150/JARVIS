# JARVIS
Made a desktop voice assistant JARVIS using Python, can be used on any OS such as Windows,Mac OS,Linux etc.

First of all, I created a wishme() function that gives the greeting func‐ tionality according to our A.I system time.

After wishme() function, I have created a takeCommand() function, which helps our A.I to take command from the user. This function is also responsible for returning the user’s query in a string format.

It can do various tasks such as sending emails on your behalf,playing music,searching Wikipedia,opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser,opening any application with a single voice command.
